# Pi Code

A fork of [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) that puts the T3 Code UI on top of the [pi coding agent](https://pi.dev) — and nothing else. One provider, pi, with its full surface: pi's entire multi-provider model catalog, extensions, skills, prompt templates, sessions, and compaction, driven over pi's RPC protocol.

See [docs/providers/pi.md](./docs/providers/pi.md) for how pi is wired in.

## "Wait, what are you selling me?"

Nothing. We built T3 Code because we wanted the best possible development experience with agents. We were inspired by existing solutions like the Codex desktop app, Conductor, Claude Desktop and Cursor Glass, but none met our bar.

We wanted something performant, remote-ready, and truly open. If we ever go the wrong direction, we want you to have everything you need to fork and build the editor that you want.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> This fork requires [pi](https://pi.dev). Install it and configure at least one
> model provider API key before use:
>
> ```bash
> npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
> ```

### Try it out (install-free)

The easiest way to test T3 Code is to run the server in your terminal:

```bash
npx t3@latest
```

This will launch T3 Code's backend on your machine as well as the local web app to control your agents.

Tip: Use `npx t3@latest --help` for the full CLI reference.

### Desktop app

Install the latest version of the desktop app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/releases), or from your favorite package registry:

#### Windows (`winget`)

```bash
winget install T3Tools.T3Code
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install --cask t3-code
```

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S t3code-bin
```

### Install `vp`

T3 Code uses Vite+ so you'll need to install the global `vp` command-line tool.

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vite.plus | bash
```

#### Windows

```bash
irm https://vite.plus/ps1 | iex
```

Checkout their getting started guide for more information: https://viteplus.dev/guide/

### Install dependencies

```bash
vp i
```
